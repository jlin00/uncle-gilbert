       "413917  Very pleased with this purchase.  Great value for a full set of hooks with a few smaller ones you normally don't find.  All felt smooth and I did try a few before writing this review.  They were fine to work with and had my preferred \"Boye-type\" hook shape rather than the Susan Bates.  Sizes were marked in mm and they came in a ziplock bag.  Great set and would purchase again if the need arose.   \n",

       "443  Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large. I thought this was a more sock-like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like. Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes. These just weren't what I was looking for.   \n",

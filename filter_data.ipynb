It offers well written articles, doable recipes and easy to read stories.  Yes, it's chalk full of advertising, but in this day and age, anybody not expecting that ought to look elsewhere for entertainment.\\n\\nFamily Circle is guaranteed not to offend anyone.  It is mainstream America.   \n",

As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!   \n",

       "431         i bought a pair from DSW for 50$ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7.  and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy.  I have wide flat feet btw.  im not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort.  I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.\\nalso, i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug. it makes me feel secure :D   \n",

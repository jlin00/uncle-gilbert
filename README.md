## Instructions for Local Development 
1. First, create and activate a virtual environment if you have not already done so: 
```
$ python3 -m venv ~/venv_name
$ . ~/venv_name/bin/activate
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the project: 
```
(venv_name)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may instead choose to run the project in Google Colab instead. [Here](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-can-i-run-notebooks-of-a-github-project-in-google-colab/) are the relevant instructions.

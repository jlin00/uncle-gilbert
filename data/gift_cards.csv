"I used the text option to send these last minute gift cards to my Granddaughters (via their mom's phone). Works really well, you get a confirmation email that it has been received, and a confirmation that the cards have been redeemed. Granddaughter's very happy with the card design.

"Amazon gift cards are nothing new, and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he / she will like to order.  These gift boxes, however, are a little more classy than the standard email or printed-off versions at home as it shows you went a little further, the box is very sturdy, and I appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping.  If you're going to be spending $50 or more for a gift card, which is the minimum price to have it delivered in a gift box like this, I would recommend you gift this version to your recipients.",5.0

"I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review. I mean seriously, it's a gift card. I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times. Maybe the card activator person needs more training.' For the record, my card worked, no paper cut, and the design was perfect!",5.0

The cardboard that the gift card is glued to was all ripped and taped up when it arrived - weird - so I checked the balance to make sure it was a legit gift card before using.",5.0

Could have purchased this at a grocery store where we live but did through Amazon so I would have $49 along w/other purchases, to get the free shipping which, to me, is a good way to shop.  I don't like paying shipping fees.  Sometimes, they are more than the item I am buying, especially w/some catalog orders.",5.0

"As you can see, it's very cute. I ordered different gift cards in various dollar amounts, but I kept each gift card style to the amount the same, i.e. the mini-Amazon boxes contained only $50 gift cards. Thank goodness because each box was shrink-wrapped because there was no indication of the dollar amount on the box itself and I was much too lazy to unwrap them to check them all.

But, if you felt compelled to rip off the shrink-wrap, you can open the box and check because it's not a taped box - it's MAGNETIC!! Yes, the box is held closed by hidden magnetic force, which isn't strong but is strong enough to keep the box closed. Amazing!

I don't know how Amazon makes money off of these clever gift card containers that are shipped, but I'm sure there's some mathematical and habitual wizardry regarding gift cards and spending.

This is a fun way to make gift card giving more fun.",5.0

"This review is for the Amazon Gift Card (any amount) in the Mini Amazon Shipping Box:

Do you get excited when your Amazon Shipment arrives at your door? The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!

The little brown box is about 4.5"" x 3"" x 1"" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.

Open the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the ""Thank you"" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.

It arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.

Would it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.

Recommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!

Ideas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other ""thank you"" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.

At the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.

Love this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)",5.0

"The gift card is obviously just fine, but the ribbon on the box is not the color pictured in the first picture; if you scroll down to the 5th picture, you'll see something more like the actual.  It is two or three shades lighter than shown so looks less classy, in my book.  The picture makes it look as if it is a deep, rich wine color.  And of course, the bow would have to be ironed to look as perky as in the picture.  It comes rather flattened, wrapped in plastic.",3.0

"How great it is to have a Starbucks Card so we can zip into Starbucks and get a coffee and sometimes a little sweet treat to get our mornings started off right..... it is great to know we have these cards as sometimes it can get long between paydays and we can always say, ""Hey, we can use our Starbucks card and we aren't as bad off as we thought until payday rolls around again"".",5.0
"Cafe Au Lait, Cappacino, Mocha Latter, Chai Tea, black coffee!! All these scrumptious drinks & more (including bake goods) are available from morning thru evening every day! A gift card from Starbucks is always appreciated and used!",5.0
Wished I had got one. O well maybe next year. Great idea for stocking stuffers. Good gift for the hard to please,5.0
Love to get this gift card for relatives and friends.  Who can't find something tasty at Starbucks and it's fun to pop in there to treat yourself during the day.  Your relatives and friends will think of you each time they use the card.  Good to remind them to register the card with Starbucks in case it gets lost.  I got this for my mail lady as a thank you for bringing all of those Amazon boxes up to the door in the winter and rain.  It's a great gift to send to a loved one.,5.0

"I was lucky to buy this for $20 as part of the ""Today's Deals"" so I got an extra $5 on the card. The card arrived really fast. I read some reviews that said they received cards with 0 credit on them. I logged on to Regal's site and verified I had a $25 balance so I'm happy. I go to Regal every week so this card helps me to get a free soda with the $5 I saved off of the original price. I hope they do this deal again soon. Too bad you can only buy 1 card at the special price.",5.0

"This review is for the Brinker Gift Card that can be used at any of the 4 restaurants: Chili's, Macaroni Grill, Maggianos, or On the Border. These are great for gifts because recipient has a choice of which restaurant to use the gift card at. We usually go to Chilis & Maggianos at least once a month. Tip: Look for gift card promotions (I've seen some on Amazon Lightening Deals & deals towards the Holidays) & check the restaurants websites for promos too for joining their newsletter/ frequent guest programs. Chilis & Maggianos email coupons occasionally when you sign up for their newsletters, & these can be combined along with using these gift cards.",5.0

We do have all of them where I live so I used some at Chili's and finished it at Maggianos.  YUM!",5.0

"Ordered two of these for our 3  year old and 6 year old Granddaughters. They had a great time going to the Build - A - Bear store and picking out their animal, outfits, and accessories. The 6 year old settled on a traditional bear, while the 3 year old opted for a bunny rabbit with dresses and other accessories. It appears that $50 is about the right amount of money to put on the card(yes, that seems expensive to me, but what do I know about these things). Fun gift for the kids when you don't know what to buy them.",5.0

"We love Maggiano's and Macaroni Grill.  Great food, especially at Maggiano's where we do a lot of take-out.  But Maggiano's can get pricey so discounted gift cards really help out.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price. Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.",5.0

"UPDATE: 5/31/16

After all the ""hulabaloo"" about an empty Noodles & Co. gift card, I found out from Noodles corporate office customer setvice that you CANNOT enter all the numbers on the back of the gift card to check the balance...only the last 14 numbers from the card. As it turns out, my gift card was fully loaded and ready to use.  Apparently Noodles had several complaints about the issue over the last few months because they added a special note to their gift card page...""If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits."".

**If you recently gifted a Noodles & Co. gift card, please have your giftee recheck their card balance (only enter the last 14 digits of their card number, omitting the first 5 digits) or contact Noodles directly like I did.  You won't regret either transaction.  It would be nice if AMAZON or the gift card seller would add this info to the product description to save time & money for everyone.

The web page is:  [...]

RUNNING LOW? Check your gift card balance anytime! Enter your gift card ID number found on the back of your card in the box below and click on the ""Submit"" button. If it's time to fill up, you can refuel at your neighborhood Noodles & Company.

If your gift card number has 19 digits, please only enter the last 14 digits of your card number, omitting the first 5 digits.

TIP:  Do join the eClub rewards.  You can get free food and get coupons by email.  It's worth the extra little bit of time plus you will learn about new offerings and menu changes.  I especially love the BOGO coupons.  I like to buy a salad and get a second one for the next day or share with a friend.  Gift the card another look.

NOTE: I was not compensated for my review.

"How do I love thee, Oh, Logan's delicious Steak! Let me count the wonderful ways....I love thee lightly seasoned and cooked to perfection, as only Logan's Roadhouse can do.  I love thee alongside a delightful bucket of peanuts, which always await the hungry steak ordering customer right on the table. I love thee slathered with oh so delicious bourbon glaze or seasoned butter.  I love thee next to the mouth watering fresh yeast dinner rolls, which are served up hastily and a-plenteously!  I love thee, O Logan's, thou great and inexpensive Roadhouse restaurant, which beckons with delightful cowboy decor and a peanut-shell laden floor.  I love your buttery perfection you call broccoli, and I love your chicken and salmon dishes as well.

Hence, I love your most amazing $25 gift card, for which I only have to pay a mere $20.  Now, off to Logan's I go, for a meal fit for two for only $20!

I have never had a bad experience at Logan's.  The steak is always ALWAYS cooked to perfection.  Seasoned just right.  Meat-a-tarians, buy this card!!",5.0

"I feel like Amazon should limit what can have a product review. I mean seriously, it's a gift card. I guess if you received it and got a paper cut, you may want to warn people that there is that potential hazard. Or maybe you didn't get the correct design, to which I say again, it's a gift card. You're not getting married to it. You'll most likely toss it when you're done with it. I guess there is the chance that the card is not active when you receive it, but even still, that's not the cards fault, it is the card activator person's fault..we should be able to review them and their performance...'my card's activation seemed to be a little slow, even faulty at times. Maybe the card activator person needs more training.' For the record, my card worked, no paper cut, and the design was perfect!",5.0

Bought this on a lightening deal as a gift for my friend. There's not much to say about a gift card- yay it was a great deal! $40 for a $50 gift card. Totally worth it! Thanks Amazon!,5.0

Always check for deals of the day. I got this $50 gift card for $40 and if you subscribe to jcpennies you can get weekly deals and coupons. I always thought of jcpennies as being expensive until I went there recently. Wow do they have good clearance. This $50 will go a long way!,5.0

"What's to say? It's a $50 JCP gift card that I purchased on a lightning deal for $40. $10 free bucks, combined with store coupons = extra discount! I used it to get my hair done. Thanks Amazon & JCP!",5.0
Great deal,5.0
"We do a lot of shopping at JCPenney these days.  We buy a lot of stuff there, especially kids clothes.  They have nice prices on kids school uniforms so we stock up at the beginning of the school year every year.  Combining a discounted gift card with the in-store sales and coupons really saves a lot.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal which is a great price. Gift card discounts come up primarily during the Christmas shopping season, but this one popped up on the Deals list in May.  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.",5.0
This was a great gift and an awesome place to eat with friends or family. I will choose to give this gift card for special occasions and holidays again. It was well received by all.,5.0

"If you are planning on gifting this, then the cosmetic imperfections matter. The card came with scratches on it and the backing was crumpled. The card was stuck crooked on the backing. The card is difficult to check the balance - the # is absurdly long (unlike all the other GCs I've bought recently). If you enter it wrong, the system hangs up on you! Once I managed to enter it right, after having to call it back twice, I was able to check the balance and see that the card was loaded.",2.0

I buy the gift cards and use them when we normally go or will use them when money is tight right before payday.  The lightning deals are great and will save you between $5 and $20 depending on how much you spend.",5.0

"Honestly, these are great to give to your teens to ensure the money you give them gets used for what is supposed to be used for.  I like giving gift cards to them and know that they are using them for food, not video games or Sephora, cigarettes, or anything they could get into trouble for.  I know they at least are eating if I give them a gift card, not that they couldn't sell it, but, still better than money.  Good for traveling or if you're worried about carrying a purse with you or otherwise getting your cash stolen.  I've never had a problem with one not working, and I usually purchase directly from the local restaurant because they usually have a deal: buy a $25 gift card, receive a 6"" sub FREE.  So, win-win for everyone.",5.0

"My youngest son, 39 years old, loves the movies and goes every week.  He should review movies, all his friends contact him, to see if the movies was worth going to.  He was in Houston, which has AMC Theaters, so I bought them for him.  He lives in Richmond , Virginia which does not have AMC.  He goes to DC to use the cards also.",5.0

"Amazon made it easy for me to solve the the late Christmas present issue; Knowing which restaurants & stores the prospective recipients favoured, I sent 2-3 gift card per person.
What I like best about amazon is that no fees were charged for electronic delivery.
(Compare to buying a gift certificate from a Mall or some outlets who charge up to 5%).",5.0
"Yes, I'm leaving a review for a gift card because I had no idea what to expect and it took an embarrassingly long time to realize there is an actual gift card in the contraption.

You see the image which resembles a wide paper bag? You have to rip that piece of firm cardboard apart to reveal a gift card inside. There is no perforation anywhere, nor can you feel the gift card through the cardboard ""envelope."" The back has a barcode and such, so I thought maybe that was what needs to be scanned at checkout, but no. Again, there's a card inside.

Attached is a picture with a ruler and the gift card next to the cardboard.

The card worked as expected at Whole Foods. Thank goodness I figured out there was a gift card inside because I would've looked really dumb, forcing the cashier to scan the package's barcode, instead of the gift card.",5.0

I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.

Good to always check the balance, and if you give it as a gift make sure you tell the person to check the balance.

I like to make a little ""floral arrangement"" with various gift cards by putting in a basket or flower pot and sticking these on craft sticks (or the long Starbucks stir sticks since they're perfect long size, wooden and free) and filling in with either homemade, wrapped cake pops or various candies. You can add a $25 card along with various denominations of other cards such as Starbucks, Panera, Olive Garden, Target, Home Depot, Kroger, Papa John's....the possibilities are endless.  They have been raved over by every single person I have given them to and they make a beautiful and unique presentation.",5.0

"Go directly to the Papa John's website to order your $25 gift cards.  Here's what you get for doing so:  get an instant coupon code by email for a free large pizza.  Then, go online to use the free pizza coupon, select more pizzas, and immediately use your $25 PJ gift card.  Also, if you look, there are all kinds of specials on the PJ ordering website, such as this one that is going on at the time of this review... it's called ""Pepsi. Pizza. Rock.""  For $12 you get a large 2 topping pizza and a 2 liter drink.  Then, you receive another coupon code for a free product, such as a large pizza or a 2 liter drink.  All of mine thus far, and I do this every weekend for the past month...have been a free large pizza.  On top of all of this, you get Papa rewards, so every 25 Papa Points, you get another free large pizza.  You can't go wrong.  And the pizza is phenomenal.  And don't even get me started on that wonderful garlic butter they include in the order.  WIN! WIN!",1.0

"What can I say, everyone likes getting gift cards to Amazon and I like it when you can adjust the loaded price to fit odd numbers. My daughter-in-law just turned 39 and I was able to load it with $39 -- a tradition I have for birthdays for my kids and others close to family. She (and her tot son) are enjoying the case it came in too.",5.0

"I'm going to have to give 5 stars for this product. I like the fact a gift card let's the  birthday person spend it the way they'd like to. The downside, is that a gift card,  seems alittle impersonal; you couldn't make the choice on what to give someone? I can make a choice, and my choice is to let the birthday person splurge on whatever tickles their fancy. Hence, the gift card. I'm a practical person myself, but I'd probaly loose my mind if I recieved a vacuum or sink mats for my bd. So a gift card is a safe bet. :) The tin is just adorable too, an extra little pop.",5.0
"Amazon gift card in an adorable cupcake shaped tin- what's not to love? The Amazon card makes a great gift & the bonus tin is ""icing on the cake"". ;)  The bonus tin is about 4"" x 4.5"" & one of the cutest ways to give a gift card as a gift. The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says ""Amazon gift cards"" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.

Amazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year. Hang onto the gift card, then you can always easily add it to your account, or right into a family or friends account.",5.0
Excellent way to give someone a gift. I have used this several times and will continue to use it.,5.0

"Originally, my first review was a 1 star disaster.  I had to reschedule a ticket purchase and AMC sent the email to refund the money but the gift card kept showing $0 balance.  Finally got that problem resolved.
A few weeks went by and I receive an email from AMC.  It says that not only was the amount spent on my credit card was refunded (had to use my credit card due to no balance) but the entire balance was returned to my AMC card.  That is what a business should do when the customer is right and they are wrong.  AMC regained my business and I have since returned to AMC to see a movie.  Thank you AMC!",4.0

"Gift card purchase said it should arrive within 5 minutes, but could take longer. Took a couple hours to get it. I read some reviews that some people got a gift card with a $0.00 balance so I went to AMC's website to check mine. When I entered my card number it said I had a $0.00 balance so I had to contact customer service. I was told I would receive a refund and to purchase another card. I just placed my order for another gift card and I hope that arrives with the $50.00 balance that it's supposed to have. Be careful and check the balance immediately after receiving the card so you don't wait in a long line at the theater only to be told your gift card has a $0.00 balance.",1.0

"It's day 78 on the road since we left. Our full story @ earthen_religion on Instagram & YouTube.
I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. This e-card is BTW the MVP. Cause: Eta could be 5- 30mins for when you get the e-card. Dominos are open until 1am in some places. Once I had the code me & the girls split some Kicker chicken nuggets. Which when living outdoors in a perpetual state. Real food is prized.
 Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.

Stood there for 30 minutes and called a few different customer service numbers to see why it wouldn't work, yada yada yada, waste of time and energy. But, it works online, so that's good.",3.0

The worst place to eat food. It should earn 0 star if the system allows. The food there was too sour and customers were forced to give Olive Garden more than 20% of bill as tip for the minimum requirement. They overcharge customers and treat people bad.,1.0

"We love Olive Garden.  Food is great and they have a kid's menu that my kids really enjoy.

Obviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card.  When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off.  We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.  Best bet is to keep an eye on the Lightning Deals for gift cards and see if you can snag a good deal.",5.0

"We love Olive Garden, and I particularly love Olive Garden for lunch during the work week.  One reason I really love the gift card is that I can use it to pay for both myself and my dining friend better than using cash.  When I am paying with cash, several of my friends argue about it and insist on paying.  Sometimes, I want to pay, and I don't want them feeling guilty or fighting over who is paying.  When you have a gift card, you can just say, ""Let me pay.  I have this gift card.""  They never turn down the offer.

Now, about the restaurant.  I love nearly all the menu items, but I really REALLLLY love the Zuppa Toscana, so I usually get the unlimited soup, salad & breadsticks lunch special for $6.99.  Lunch is served fast and I always can get in and out in under an hour.  They always let me take the rest with me, even happy to provide more soup, salad and breadsticks and box it up, so, since I'm single, that's dinner.  Always great service, and let's not forget the after dinner mints.  YUM!",5.0
"Olive Garden overcharged their customers for worst food they made. Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.

After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too.",1.0
Love it!!!! Thanks!!!!,5.0
"Olive Garden is good, not your authentic Italian food but it does the trick for a chain restaurant. Some prices are a little high but the fact you get salad and bread sticks with your dinner (for takeout too) makes it worth it. I recommend the chicken Marsala,  it's my favorite item on the menu....sooo good!!",4.0

"I like getting the lightning deals for gift cards on Amazon.  Getting a $50 card for $40 is always cool especially if I normally use it or shop there anyway.  I bought this to use when we go to the movies and getting $10 free more than compensates for the extra 2 dollar charge for each ticket.  I like getting my ticket before going to the theater since it avoids the line of getting a ticket and since so many theaters now have reserved seating, it is almost becoming mandatory.  If you are running late, having your ticket already is a life saver.  The eticket is nice because I often place gift cards in drawers or weird places and have to go find them.  I can access this ticket on my phone or a computer.  How convenient!",5.0
"The ""convenience fee"" is annoying if you're not buying tickets for a movie you actually expect to be sold out, like on a premier night or something. I'm glad I bought Beauty and the Beast tickets in advance, though, because it was sold out when I got to the theater. Fandango is just nice and easy to use.",4.0

I am not into panhandling or begging since we ( Two Border Collies) set out to move. But when the weather turned cold & food started to run short. The choice was fuel to keep moving or food. Then while at a library. I remembered I have an Amazon Store Card..... Lor got a jacket to stay warm in that matches Holigraph's jacket. Some Purina moist dog for them both. Jack links to share with them, along with Cheezit's. But to look far enough into Amazon & find the section of Gift cards..... OMG!
Got the Domino's Pizza E-Gift card. It came 27 1/2mins after purchase. Then had the Taco Bell & Burger King gift cards sent to my Address on the road. When online at both to check balances after they showed up 24hrs later.

"I was weary about purchasing this product because of all of those 1-star reviews. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.",5.0

"The gift card and outside of the tin get 5 stars on this.  The inside of the tin, however, is the cause for a 3-star review.  I thought the black inner holder (if you will) would come with the tin, as pictured.  However, when I received it, the gift card is loose inside of the tin, and there's no way to secure it inside the tin.  This is probably a minor detail, but I'm very into the appearance of gifts, so I'm a bit disappointed.",3.0

"This Santa Tin is really cute. At current time of writing, the tin is free when you purchase a $25+ amazon gift card. This is a nice bonus & a great way to give a Christmas gift. The tin is about 5"" x 4.5"" x 1"", and has a clear window at the bottom so you can see the gift card inside. This one is a bit of an odd shape because of the santa hat shape, but still very cute. :)",5.0

Who wouldn't love an Amazon gift card???!!!  They loved the Santa card holder.

Definitely recommend.",5.0
"Amazon gift cards are nothing new, and they are very handy to give as gifts due to the diverse nature of products Amazon offers  certainly your recipient can find something he / she will like to order. These gift boxes, however, are a little more classy than the standard email or printed-off versions at home as it shows you went a little further, the box is very sturdy, and I appreciate the fact Amazon delivers it for free with next day shipping. If you're going to be spending $50 or more for a gift card, which is the minimum price to have it delivered in a gift box like this, I would recommend you gift this version to your recipients.",5.0

"Envelope is really cute. The size is 4"" x 2"" & has a string so you can hang it or attach it to the top of a gift. I ordered so I can give as a small gift, attach to a gift as an extra, or as a stocking stuffer. I ordered the $10 card (looks like $10 is the min), but you can order higher denominations. The gift card has the amount printed on the front. The back of the envelope has a see thru window opening so you can see the bar code, & 2 blank lines you can use to write a message.",5.0

Plush white, with a red & white hat & mittens. Hang tag says Amazon Exclusive 9th edition bear by Gund. Really adorable!  Would make a great gift or for yourself as a keepsake collectible.",5.0

This is the easy part. Its the ppl at safeway who have no idea how to redeem them.

"Very easy to use this gift card. I just wish I would have been able to use it at Drury Inn, but that hotel didn't take online gift cards. There is a large selection of hotels to choose from though. The gift card arrived right on time, with super fast delivery. This gift card made making reservations quick and easy, and took away a lot of the stress involved in traveling. Would definitely buy another gift card in the future when I plan on traveling. Even with making last minute bookings was able to get a nice hotel at a reasonable price. The only thing that would make this gift card better is an email delivery option. Other than that well worthy buy.",4.0

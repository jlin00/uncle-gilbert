167,"Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

204,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

208,Glad I read the reviews and ordered a half size too big. These are light weight. I worked out in them last night and had a great work out. They are very comfortable. I would recommend these to anyone. I am a Beach Body Coach and these are now my new favorite shoes to work out in. I feel like I am walking in slippers when I wear these shoes. They are so comfortable. I LOVE them so much. I never buy myself anything nice and for Christmas got an Amazon gift card and used it to buy myself these sneakers and they are so awesome. I really do love them and have been telling all my friends about them. GET THESE SHOES!,5.0
209,"On the left shoe, there were two stained yellow spots.",3.0
210,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
211,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

215,"I **loved** these shoes when I got them. I've noticed that the foam inside tends to compress during a workout, though. I'll lace them tightly enough that they're nearly cutting off my circulation. 20 minutes later, I'm sliding out of them while doing sled pushes.",2.0
216,She loves them,5.0
217,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

Overall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away.",3.0

230,"My favorite running shoes!  The wall of the shoe is very thin, which makes them very comfortable to wear if your feet swell as you run.  I would not recommend for use on concrete or a treadmill, as there isn't very much impact absorption, but they are perfect for trail running!",5.0

232,"I bought these for gym training - weight class and dance class (body jam, Zumba) - and really wanted to like them, since I loved the color and the light weight feel. But when I worked out high impact, my toes tingled, went numb and cramped because the toe bed is very narrow. Also, there wasn't enough cushion for me. When doing lunges, the ball of my feet hurt.

I ordered the shoes half a size up because as a former runner, I'm used to my feet needing room to spread and swell. I wish I hadn't because they feel a little roomy. I have orthotics, so I think I can remedy the issue once I swap those in.

Otherwise, very good shoes",4.0
294,"Good indoor training shoes for running on treadmill, doing lunges and regular exercises at the gym. These are very flexible, light weight and comfortable. Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars.

467,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

472,"I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo).

656,"It's been a long time since I've worked a cross training shoe. This shoe is very light and minimally passed compared to running shoes. That's not meant to be a knock, just a fact.

I ordered the shoes half a size up because as a former runner, I'm used to my feet needing room to spread and swell. I wish I hadn't because they feel a little roomy. I have orthotics, so I think I can remedy the issue once I swap those in.

Otherwise, very good shoes",4.0
657,"Good indoor training shoes for running on treadmill, doing lunges and regular exercises at the gym. These are very flexible, light weight and comfortable. Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars.

748,"I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.",4.0

830,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

835,"I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.
I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms. They really give me support and flex needed. I have also used Asics and Puma.",3.0

The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches.  The shoe tends to run about a half size long though, especially for Nike.  I am working on getting in shape, and these shoes feel good all day... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel.  Very pleased.",5.0

843,Love my new Nike's.  It's been years since I've been able to wear them (sizing changed years ago and I just couldn't wear them any more) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect.  Lightweight shoe with tons of style.  The Fog color is just what I was looking for...not black and not neon!  I wore them to participate in Relay for Life (24 hour walk) and they held up great!,5.0
844,"I am so happy with this purchase. I feel like I'm barely wearing a sneaker when working out. Another plus is that when I take off my sneaker, my sock is barely sweaty! I have never had that experience with a shoe. The shoe is also very attractive and flattering and looks nice on my feet.",5.0

854,"This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever had. No other shoe can compare to how the individual nubs on the bottom allow your foot to be cushioned, yet work like it's suppose to. My feet feel cradled in this shoe and hard surfaces don't make my feet ache anymore.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

Highly recommended for walking/running on concrete or tracks. As long as nike continues to make the flex supreme, they will get my money. Please don't change this shoe!",5.0

I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail.

865,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

I know some people personally like when the shoes are a bit tighter or a bit looser so it's all in personal preference.",5.0

Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

922,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

928,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
929,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

935,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

1077,"There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe. That's okay, though. I usually wear socks, so it doesn't feel too big, even if it does make your foot look a bit long.

The colors are vibrant, and the sole has plenty of grip, even on a slippery floor. I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable.

These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability.

1103,"I was wearing running shoes for cardio dance classes at the gym because I thought they would be sufficient. After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers. Also, the lacing is done in a way that allows you to tie too tightly if you're not careful (my toes were tingling during one particular work out when I had done this). Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.",4.0

I have wide flat feet btw.  im not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort.  I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.

1185,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

1190,"I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights. Super cute and flezable. BUT for running, absolutely not!! It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

1220,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

1290,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

1296,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
1297,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

1303,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.",4.0

I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.

1553,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

1588,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

1660,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

1665,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
1666,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

1672,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

1922,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

1957,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

1974,"Tried them on in a store before buying online so I knew they'd fit good. Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable. Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet don't slide out from under me while doing planks, push-ups, etc. Highly satisfied with this purchase.",5.0

1993,"Great shoe. I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

2030,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

2035,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
2036,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

2041,She loves them,5.0
2042,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

I've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they won't give me enough support when running.  they're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible, but i don't know if they'll last long if you use them everywhere else.  :(  i really like them but i cant just buy 2 different shoes.

2292,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride. I run about 2-4 miles every few days. Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

2327,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

I received many compliments the first time I wore them to the gym.  They are super soft and comfortable from the leg all the way to the waist...COMFORTABLE.  They never slip down at the waist and give me full coverage (not see through at all). I am 5' 4"" and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium.  The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.  We are in the high 90's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool!  Purchase these as you won't be disappointed especially at this price.

2362,My ring shipped the same day that I placed the order and was received well before the estimated delivery date. It is absolutely beautiful!! It is a substantial ring without being overly heavy and is very comfortable to wear. I've cooked and cleaned with it on and it is still free of scratches and the finish is beautifully shiny. It also runs true to size. I highly recommend this ring and this seller!! Will definitely do business with them again.,5.0
2363,"I am changing my review after a second washing.
I am a male size 9 wide and after washing  they are a very tight fit. They are mid calf, wide enough at the toe, but snug from toe to heel. That said I think a male size 8 is about it. Larger size feet might have a problem. Quality is OK for the price. You will see these socks sold singly on other sites at $12.99 each!  I like the socks and ordered a second set to put in my daughters Christmas stocking.",3.0

Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

2434,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

I would recommend these to anyone. I am a Beach Body Coach and these are now my new favorite shoes to work out in. I feel like I am walking in slippers when I wear these shoes. They are so comfortable. I LOVE them so much. I never buy myself anything nice and for Christmas got an Amazon gift card and used it to buy myself these sneakers and they are so awesome. I really do love them and have been telling all my friends about them. GET THESE SHOES!,5.0
2439,"On the left shoe, there were two stained yellow spots.",3.0
2440,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
2441,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

2446,She loves them,5.0
2447,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair.

2697,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

2732,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable.

Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!",5.0

2810,"Very good overall.
Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.
Solid choice, overall.",4.0

2815,"On the left shoe, there were two stained yellow spots.",3.0
2816,"I love these, I had the previous iteration (or maybe two earlier?) and finally wore them out after several years. They are definitely a light-weight training shoe so I wouldn't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running. But this also makes them extremely comfortable, I hadn't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these. Good support and my feet stay cool all day, also noticeably light but well-made and long lasting.

I have worn them hiking in a pinch but don't really recommend it because the material is mesh-like and will let a lot of dirt in. But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further.",5.0
2817,"Super light-weight, decent arch support (mine is higher than average).  I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!",5.0

2823,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.

The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.

After getting 2 blood blisters I did some research and found out cross trainers would be more appropriate which is how I ended up buying this pair. They are slightly longer in look then I  would like but I think that is typical of cross trainers.

Other then that I am very happy with the shoes.",4.0

3071,"Favorite training and walking-around sneakers.
They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",5.0

Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill. Just after running with these 3 times, I am having major back issues that I have never had before.

MY STATS and other shoes:
I road and trail run. I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road. I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner. Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner.

These shoes have a small amount of support, but not much, which I like as I'm coming from vibram five fingers. (Sorry vffs, I'm bailing after 2 years of shin splints, no matter what I did).

3106,"I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long. I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",4.0

3131,Favorite Nike shoe ever! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot. These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot. I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend!,5.0

3134,"Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly. I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time. I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color.",5.0

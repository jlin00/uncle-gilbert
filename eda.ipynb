I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend!   \n",

I found this palette to be convenient and have unique packaging and to be a well put together kit with all the 'must haves' in one package. I also didn't find the product to be small like some, I found it to be a decent size and the quality of the make-up to be above average. Jouer has all the basics wrapped into one here, each with their neat little compartments and mirrors included. You get a palette for eyes, face, lip gloss and a tint and highlighter. Only thing they didn't have was a small applicator or brush with it. This they could've added for conveniency as i've seen in other palette's such as this but still it impressed me. I also think the colors included are very neutral/wearable and blend well or would look good on most people. Product comes in a nice sheer translucent bag. Would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else, if you're willing to spend a bit extra for what I'd call quality.</td>\n",

       "25097   I am a bit of a connoisseur for these types of items and this impressed me. I found this palette to be convenient and have unique packaging and to be a well put together kit with all the 'must haves' in one package. I also didn't find the product to be small like some, I found it to be a decent size and the quality of the make-up to be above average. Jouer has all the basics wrapped into one here, each with their neat little compartments and mirrors included. You get a palette for eyes, face, lip gloss and a tint and highlighter. Only thing they didn't have was a small applicator or brush with it. This they could've added for conveniency as i've seen in other palette's such as this but still it impressed me. I also think the colors included are very neutral/wearable and blend well or would look good on most people. Product comes in a nice sheer translucent bag. Would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else, if you're willing to spend a bit extra for what I'd call quality.   \n",

So when I ordered this step drill in an attempt to cut a 1 1/8\" hole in mild steel, my expectations were not high.  But I was absolutely wrong.  This little beauty drilled four holes through 3/16\" thick steel and looks as if it was still brand new and untouched!!  I'm very impressed and would recommend it, especially for use in a drill press.   \n",
